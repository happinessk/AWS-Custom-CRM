## About 
This cloud service allows event coordinators to gather emails at events and upload them to a WordPress web application. On a daily basis, the emails will be pulled from WordPress and ent out to the recipients with more details about the event and future events. 

This new service allows for distributed email uploading (web app), standardized emailing (templates), and timely emailing (scheduled).
